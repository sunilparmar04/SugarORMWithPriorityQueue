# Customheightviewpager
This is the simplest example of SugarORM(no need DB helper for SQLite).
SugarORM is like Room for Android,But SugarORM more easier then room becuase we don't need to take care for write quries for QUERD operation.
In this example i used SugarORM  to save user details and i used SaveDataService servive to saved bulk of data in background in onPause() method.

in service i used PriorityBlockingQueue  to create Queue to saved data.
